- what is Python:
  - a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java
  - a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language
  - a program language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively

- interpreter vs compiler:
  - interpretor (like a translator) goes through line by line of code and each line execute the instruction on the machine
  - compiler takes the whole file and transits it to machine code
